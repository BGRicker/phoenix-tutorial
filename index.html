	<p>
	I imagine right now you're feeling a bit like Alice.  Tumbling down the rabbit hole.  I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees, because he is expecting to wake up.
	</p>


	<p>
	Let me tell you why you're here.  You're here because you know something.  What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.  You've felt it your entire life.  That there's something wrong in the world.  You don't know what it is, but it's there.  Like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.
	</p>
<h3>
Do you want to know what it is?

After this, there is no turning back.

<h4>If you take the blue pill</h4>
<p>The story ends, you navigate away from this page and you believe whatever you want to believe.
</p>

<p>
	You believe that <a href="https://github.com/kzk/unicorn-worker-killer">killing unicorns</a> is a reasonable approach to keep processes from running away eating memory.
</p>

<p>
You believe that <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">sidekiq</a> solves your concurrency issues, even though you can't be sure that when your background tasks actually execute.
</p>

<p>
You believe your application is <strong>fault tolerant enough</strong>, even though you've spent zero thought about how your application should deal with exceptional cases.
</p>

<p>
You believe all functional programming languages have obnoxious syntax and that's the reason they have small followings and small communities.
</p>

<h4>If you take the red pill</h4>
<p>
You stay in wonderland, and I'll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
</p>
<p>
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth.
